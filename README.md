This repository contains my project "Lung Cancer Prediction With Machine Learning"
Lung Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms
Lung cancer remains one of the top causes of cancer-related mortality globally. Early detection and accurate prediction are essential for enhancing survival rates and ensuring timely treatment. This project focuses on creating a reliable machine learning model to predict lung cancer using patient data, leveraging a variety of machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy and dependability.

Objectives
The main goals of this project include:

Preprocessing and analyzing patient data to identify key features associated with lung cancer.
Developing and comparing different machine learning models to identify the most effective algorithm for lung cancer prediction.
Evaluating the performance of these models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deploying the best-performing model for making predictions on new patient data.
Machine Learning Algorithms
This project will explore and implement several machine learning algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression: A statistical technique for predicting binary outcomes by modeling the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
Decision Trees: A non-parametric model that makes decisions based on a series of rules derived from the data features.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to enhance predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A supervised learning model that finds the optimal hyperplane to maximize the margin between different classes.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors.
Gradient Boosting: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, with each model correcting the errors of the previous ones, to achieve high accuracy.
AdaBoost: An ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier by focusing on the errors of the previous classifiers and giving more weight to misclassified instances.
Bagging: An ensemble method that improves the stability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms by training multiple versions of the same algorithm on different subsets of the training data and then combining their predictions.
Impact
By employing these machine learning algorithms, this project aims to develop a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing lung cancer at an early stage. The insights from this project could lead to better patient outcomes and potentially save lives through timely and accurate diagnosis.
